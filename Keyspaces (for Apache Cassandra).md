Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available, and managed Apache Cassandra–compatible database service. With Amazon Keyspaces, you don’t have to provision, patch, or manage servers, and you don’t have to install, maintain, or operate software.

Amazon Keyspaces is serverless, so you pay for only the resources that you use, and the service automatically scales tables up and down in response to application traffic. You can build applications that serve thousands of requests per second with virtually unlimited throughput and storage.

Amazon Keyspaces makes it easy to migrate, run, and scale Cassandra workloads in the AWS Cloud. With just a few clicks on the AWS Management Console or a few lines of code, you can create keyspaces and tables in Amazon Keyspaces, without deploying any infrastructure or installing software.

With Amazon Keyspaces, you can run your existing Cassandra workloads on AWS using the same Cassandra application code and developer tools that you use today.
