AWS Control Tower offers a straightforward way to set up and govern an AWS multi-account environment, following prescriptive best practices. AWS Control Tower orchestrates the capabilities of several other AWS services, including AWS Organizations, AWS Service Catalog, and AWS IAM Identity Center, to build a landing zone in less than an hour. Resources are set up and managed on your behalf.

AWS Control Tower orchestration extends the capabilities of AWS Organizations. To help keep your organizations and accounts from drift, which is divergence from best practices, AWS Control Tower applies controls (sometimes called guardrails). For example, you can use controls to help ensure that security logs and necessary cross-account access permissions are created, and not altered.

If you are hosting more than a handful of accounts, itâ€™s beneficial to have an orchestration layer that facilitates account deployment and account governance. You can adopt AWS Control Tower as your primary way to provision accounts and infrastructure. With AWS Control Tower, you can more easily adhere to corporate standards, meet regulatory requirements, and follow best practices.
