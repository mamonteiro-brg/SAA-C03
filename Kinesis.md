Amazon Kinesis is comprised of different services, which are:
    Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
    Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
    Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics
    Amazon Kinesis Video Streams



"Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to save data to Amazon EBS‚Äù 
    Is incorrect as you cannot save data to EBS from Kinesis.




Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) 
    Is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources. You can use an AWS Lambda function to process records in Amazon KDS. By default, Lambda invokes your function as soon as records are available in the stream. Lambda can process up to 10 batches in each shard simultaneously. If you increase the number of concurrent batches per shard, Lambda still ensures in-order processing at the partition-key level.

    Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is used to collect and process large streams of data records in real-time. You can use Kinesis Data Streams for rapid and continuous data intake and aggregation. The type of data used includes IT infrastructure log data, application logs, social media, market data feeds, and web clickstream data. Because the response time for the data intake and processing is in real-time, the processing is typically lightweight.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
    Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, Splunk, and any custom HTTP endpoint or HTTP endpoints owned by supported third-party service providers, including Datadog, Dynatrace, LogicMonitor, MongoDB, New Relic, Coralogix, and Elastic. Kinesis Data Firehose is part of the Kinesis streaming data platform, along with Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Video Streams, and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. With Kinesis Data Firehose, you don't need to write applications or manage resources. You configure your data producers to send data to Kinesis Data Firehose, and it automatically delivers the data to the destination that you specified. You can also configure Kinesis Data Firehose to transform your data before delivering it.

    Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you are already using today.

    Kinesis Data Streams enables you to build custom applications that process or analyze streaming data for specialized needs. The diagram below shows the architecture of a Kinesis Data Streams application:
    Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is the easiest way to process and analyze real-time, streaming data. Kinesis Data Analytics can use standard SQL queries to process Kinesis data streams and can ingest data from Kinesis Streams and Kinesis Firehose.
