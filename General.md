blueprint
    A blueprint in computer science is a plan or a set of instructions used to create a software program. It is a detailed step-by-step guide that outlines the necessary tasks to be completed in order to create a working software program. A blueprint can be thought of as a map that shows the programmer the path from start to finish.
    Creating a blueprint is the first step in the software development process. It is important to have a detailed and well-planned blueprint before starting to code, as it will make the development process much smoother and will help to avoid any mistakes or unforeseen problems.
    A blueprint typically contains a list of all the required software components, as well as a description of how those components will work together. It also includes a timeline for the development process and a budget for the project. Once the blueprint is complete, the programmer can start working on the actual coding.
