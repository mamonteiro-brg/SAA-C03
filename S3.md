Routing traffic to a website that is hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/RoutingToS3Bucket.html


    Here are the prerequisites for routing traffic to a website that is hosted in an Amazon S3 Bucket:

        – An S3 bucket that is configured to host a static website. The bucket must have the same name as your domain or subdomain. For example, if you want to use the subdomain portal.tutorialsdojo.com, the name of the bucket must be portal.tutorialsdojo.com.

        – A registered domain name. You can use Route 53 as your domain registrar, or you can use a different registrar.

        – Route 53 as the DNS service for the domain. If you register your domain name by using Route 53, we automatically configure Route 53 as the DNS service for the domain.


        
Use Server-Side Encryption: 
    You request Amazon S3 to encrypt your object before saving it on disks in its data centers and decrypt it when you download the objects.

Use Client-Side Encryption:
    You can encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.


AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3
    With AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3, you can provision interface VPC endpoints (interface endpoints) in your virtual private cloud (VPC). These endpoints are directly accessible from applications that are on premises over VPN and AWS Direct Connect, or in a different AWS Region over VPC peering.

    Interface endpoints are represented by one or more elastic network interfaces (ENIs) that are assigned private IP addresses from subnets in your VPC. Requests to Amazon S3 over interface endpoints stay on the Amazon network. You can also access interface endpoints in your VPC from on-premises applications through AWS Direct Connect or AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS VPN). For more information about how to connect your VPC with your on-premises network, see the AWS Direct Connect User Guide and the AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide.


S3 Transfer Acceleration
    Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration is designed to optimize transfer speeds from across the world into S3 buckets. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of the globally distributed edge locations in Amazon CloudFront. As the data arrives at an edge location, the data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

Archive retrieval options (S3 Glacier)
    The following are the available retrieval options when restoring an archived object in Amazon S3:
        Expedited 
        Standard
        Bulk



“Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration” Is used to accelerate uploads of data to Amazon S3 buckets.


Server-side encryption is about protecting data at rest. Server-side encryption encrypts only the object data, not object metadata. Using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) allows you to set your own encryption keys. With the encryption key you provide as part of your request, Amazon S3 manages the encryption as it writes to disks and decryption when you access your objects. Therefore, you don’t need to maintain any code to perform data encryption and decryption. The only thing you do is manage the encryption keys you provide.
When you upload an object, Amazon S3 uses the encryption key you provide to apply AES-256 encryption to your data and removes the encryption key from memory. When you retrieve an object, you must provide the same encryption key as part of your request. Amazon S3 first verifies that the encryption key you provided matches and then decrypts the object before returning the object data to you.
