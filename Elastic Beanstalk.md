AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, or Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS. Elastic Beanstalk is a complete application management solution, and manages all infrastructure and platform tasks on your behalf.

    With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy, manage, and scale applications without the operational burden of managing infrastructure. Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity for web applications, making it a good choice for organizations that are new to AWS or wish to deploy a web application as quickly as possible.

    When using Elastic Beanstalk as your deployment solution, simply upload your source code and Elastic Beanstalk will provision and operate all necessary infrastructure, including servers, databases, load balancers, networks, and auto scaling groups. Although these resources are created on your behalf, you retain full control of these resources, allowing developers to customize as needed.
