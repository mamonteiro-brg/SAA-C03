Amazon CloudWatch Events
    Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams.

    CloudWatch Events becomes aware of operational changes as they occur. CloudWatch Events responds to these operational changes and takes corrective action as necessary, by sending messages to respond to the environment, activating functions, making changes, and capturing state information.

    You can configure rules in Amazon CloudWatch Events to alert you to changes in AWS services and integrate these events with other third-party systems using Amazon EventBridge.



There is no standard metric in CloudWatch for collecting EC2 memory usage. However, you can use the CloudWatch agent to collect both system metrics and log files from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. The metrics can be pushed to a CloudWatch custom metric.
