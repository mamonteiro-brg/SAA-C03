AWS AppSync 
    AWS AppSync is a serverless GraphQL and Pub/Sub API service that simplifies building modern web and mobile applications. It provides a robust, scalable GraphQL interface for application developers to combine data from multiple sources, including Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and HTTP APIs.

    AppSync pipeline resolvers offer an elegant server-side solution to address the common challenge faced in web applicationsâ€”aggregating data from multiple database tables. Instead of invoking multiple API calls across different data sources, which can degrade application performance and user experience, AppSync pipeline resolvers enable easy retrieval of data from multiple sources with just a single call. By leveraging Pipeline functions, these resolvers streamline the process of consolidating and presenting data to end-users.

    AWS AppSync enables developers to connect their applications and services to data and events with secure, serverless and high-performing GraphQL and Pub/Sub APIs. You can do the following with AWS AppSync:

    Access data from one or more data sources from a single GraphQL API endpoint.

    Combine multiple source GraphQL APIs into a single, merged GraphQL API.

    Publish real-time data updates to your applications.

    Leverage built-in security, monitoring, logging, and tracing, with optional caching for low latency.

    Only pay for API requests and any real-time messages that are delivered.
