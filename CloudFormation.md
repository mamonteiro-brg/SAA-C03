AWS CloudFormation 
    Is a service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, and provision and manage them in an orderly and predictable fashion.


AWS CloudFormation provides two methods for updating stacks: 
    direct update or creating and executing change sets. When you directly update a stack, you submit changes and AWS CloudFormation immediately deploys them.
    Use direct updates when you want to quickly deploy your updates. With change sets, you can preview the changes AWS CloudFormation will make to your stack, and then decide whether to apply those changes.
