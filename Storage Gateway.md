### AWS Storage Gateway

    AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. Storage Gateway provides a standard set of storage protocols such as iSCSI, SMB, and NFS, which allow you to use AWS storage without rewriting your existing applications. It provides low-latency performance by caching frequently accessed data on premises, while storing data securely and durably in Amazon cloud storage services. Storage Gateway optimizes data transfer to AWS by sending only changed data and compressing data. Storage Gateway also integrates natively with Amazon S3 and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server cloud storage, which makes your data available for in-cloud processing, AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) for securing access management to services and resources, AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for encrypting data at rest in the cloud, Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, and AWS CloudTrail for logging account activity.
