AWS Glue 

    Is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service. AWS Glue makes it cost-effective to categorize your data, clean it, enrich it, and move it reliably between various data stores and data streams. This pattern provides different job types in AWS Glue and uses three different scripts to demonstrate authoring ETL jobs.
